This project implements a small lobby + session system for Tic-Tac-Toe using React + Vite + React Router.

## What it supports

- Game view: Tic-Tac-Toe with start → playing → end (win/draw)
- Simple move history and winning highlight

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)
```
